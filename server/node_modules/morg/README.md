# morg
A media organizer tool designed to help keep large media libraries organized by renaming files and folders to a standard (Plex-friendly) format, and cleaning up garbage files.

## Installation
`morg` is designed to be a globally-installed, CLI-based, NodeJS module, so you'll need to [have NodeJS installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

```bash
npm i -g morg
```

## Usage
> NOTE: `morg` has only been tested on MacOS and Linux environments

Start `morg` by navigating to a directory filled with media folders (e.g. movie folders) and invoking it like any other native command or global NodeJS module.

`morg` will scan the directory for sub-folders, and will walk you through a series of prompted questions for each one, gathering the information it needs to properly clean up the files.
